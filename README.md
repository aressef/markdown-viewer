# markdown-viewer
markdown-viewer project for freeCodeCamp

## Project Requirements:
1. I can see a `textarea` element with corresponding `id="editor"`.
2. I can see an element with a corresponding `id="preview"`.
3. When I enter text into the `#editor` element, the `#preview` element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.
4. When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the `#editor` element, the text is rendered as HTML in the `#preview` element as I type.
5. When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements:
	* a header (h1 size)
	* a sub header (h2 size)
	* a link
	* inline code
	* a code block
	* a list item
	* a blockquote
	* an image
	* bolded text
6. When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the `#editor` field should be rendered as HTML in the `#preview` element.
* Optional Bonus
	* When I click a link rendered by my markdown previewer, the link is opened up in a new tab.
	* My markdown previewer interprets carriage returns and renders them as `br` (line break) elements.
